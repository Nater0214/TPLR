# The Parking Lot Robot
## Introduction
This is the code for my capstones project 8th grade. ~~Hello future self lol.~~ This is a robot that will pick up metalic objects from parking lots. This includes nails, screws, or other random crap thats made out of metal. One of the other things that fall under the catergory of 'random crap thats made out of metal' is change. Thats what this robot was intitaly going to be for but then I decided it would be genious if it picked up **everything**.
## Other Info
If you're seeing this, then you are probably Mr. White and you dont need any more information about this, though if you're not then here's some more info.  
All information is on a google site, which is not currently public, but I probably will in the future.
